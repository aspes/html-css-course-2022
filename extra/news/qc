Topological quantum computing aims to stabilize qubits by utilizing Majorana particles, which are their own antiparticles. 
These particles enable the creation of topological qubits that are inherently more stable and resistant to errors. 
Microsoft's recent development of the Majorana 1 chip leverages this approach, using a novel material called a "topoconductor" 
to produce reliable qubits through the manipulation of Majorana particles.
